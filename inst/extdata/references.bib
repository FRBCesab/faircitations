	abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

We aimed to assess journal authors’ current knowledge and perceptions of open access and author-pays publishing.
Design
An electronic survey.
Setting
Authors of research papers submitted to BMJ, Archives of Disease in Childhood, and Journal of Medical Genetics in 2004.
Main outcome measures
Familiarity with and perceptions of open access and author-pays publishing. Results: 468/1113 (42\%) responded. Prior to definitions being provided, 47\% (222/468) and 38\% (176/468) reported they were familiar with the terms ‘open access’ and ‘authorpays’ publishing, respectively. Some who did not at first recognize the terms, did claim to recognize them when they were defined. Only 10\% (49/468) had submitted to an author-pays journal. Compared with non-open access subscription-based journals, 35\% agreed that open access author-pays journals have a greater capacity to publish more content making it easier to get published, 27\% thought they had lower impact factors, 31\% thought they had faster and more timely publicaitons, and 46\% agreed that people will think anyone can pay to get published. 55\% (256/468) thought they would not continue to submit to their respective journal if it became open access and charged, largely because of the reputaiton of the journals. Half (54\%, 255/468) said open access has ‘no impact’ or was ‘low priority’ in their submission decisions. Two-thirds (66\%, 308/468) said they would prefer to submit to a non-open access subscription-based journal than an open access author-pays journal. Over half thought they would have to make a contribution or pay the full cost of an author charge (56\%, 262/468).
Conclusions
The survey yielded useful information about respondents’ knowledge and perceptions of these publishing models. Authors have limited familiarity with the concept of open-access publishing and surrounding issues. Currently, open access policies have little impact on authors’ decision of where to submit papers.},

However, recent concerns about their applicability for research evaluation suggested these indicators could depend on historical and socioeconomic factors associated with scholarly publishing tradition and business, respectively. The present study addressed this issue quantitatively, using data on h-index and Scimago Journal Rank (SJR) for 566 journals within the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, and applying Partial Least Squared Structural Equation Modelling. The Tradition Model accounted for \&lt;50\% of the variation in h-index and SJR, showing that journals’ performance increased with an increase in articles’ international collaboration, and decreased for journals published by non-profit organizations. The Business Model accounted for \&gt;60\% of the variation in h-index and SJR, showing that journals’ performance increased in association with the global50 ranking of publishers and high article processing charges. Countries recognized as world science centres, the use of English, the journal’s, and publisher’s year of origin, and the increase in science investment and scientific production promoted by the richest economies worldwide had no impact on journal performance. Results suggest that the h-index for journals and the SJR reflect multi-dimensional aspects of scholarly publishing, potentially affected by marketing strategies boosted by the biggest commercial publishers. Given the limitations of poor scientific communities in terms of publication costs, uncritical application of these indexes for research evaluation worldwide may reinforce the idea that high quality research is produced only by rich scientific societies.},

            The publish‐or‐perish culture in academia has catalysed the development of an unethical publishing system. This system is characterised by the proliferation of journals and publishers—unaffiliated with learned societies or universities—that maintain extremely large revenues and profit margins diverting funds away from the academic community. Early career researchers (ECRs) are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of this publishing system because of intersecting factors, including pressure to pursue high impact publications, rising publication costs and job insecurity. Moving towards a more ethical system requires that scientists advocate for structural change by making career choices that come with risks, many of which disproportionately impact ECRs. We illuminate major issues facing ECRs in Ecology and Evolution under the current publishing system, and propose a portfolio of actions to promote systemic change that can be implemented by ECRs and established researchers.},

	abstract = {The academic journal publishing model is deeply unethical: today, a few major,  for-profit conglomerates control more than 50\% of all articles in the natural sciences and social sciences, driving subscription and open-access publishing fees above levels that can be sustainably maintained by publicly funded universities, libraries, and research institutions worldwide. About a third of the costs paid for publishing papers is profit for these dominant publishers' shareholders, and about half of them covers costs to keep the system running, including lobbying, marketing fees, and paywalls. The paywalls in turn restrict access of scientific outputs, preventing them from being freely shared with the public and other researchers. Thus, money that the public is told goes into science is actually being funneled away from it, or used to limit access to it. Alternatives to this model exist and have increased in popularity in recent years, including diamond open-access journals and community-driven recommendation models. These are free of charge for authors and minimize costs for institutions and agencies, while making peer-reviewed scientific results publicly accessible. However, for-profit publishing agents have made change difficult, by co-opting open-access schemes and creating journal-driven incentives that prevent an effective collective transition away from profiteering. Here, we give a brief overview of the current state of the academic publishing system, including its most important systemic problems. We then describe alternative systems. We explain the reasons why the move toward them can be perceived as costly to individual researchers, and we demystify common roadblocks to change. Finally, in view of the above, we provide a set of guidelines and recommendations that academics at all levels can implement, in order to enable a more rapid and effective transition toward ethical publishing.},

The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor \& Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50\% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70\% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20\% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing.},

	abstract = {The journal impact factor (Journal Impact Factor (JIF)) is, by far, the most discussed bibliometric indicator. Since its introduction over 40 years ago, it has had enormous effects on the scientific ecosystem: transforming the publishing industry, shaping hiring practices and the allocation of resources, and, as a result, reorienting the research activities and dissemination practices of scholars. Given both the ubiquity and impact of the indicator, the JIF has been widely dissected and debated by scholars of every disciplinary orientation. Drawing on the existing literature as well as original research, this chapter provides a brief history of the indicator and highlights well-known limitations—such as the asymmetry between the numerator and the denominator, differences across disciplines, the insufficient citation window, and the skewness of the underlying citation distributions. The inflation of the JIF and the weakening predictive power is discussed, as well as the adverse effects on the behaviors of individual actors and the research enterprise. Alternative journal-based indicators are described and the chapter concludes with a call for responsible application and a commentary on future developments in journal indicators.},

	abstract = {In the pre-Internet era, commercial publishers like Elsevier and Wiley played an important role in disseminating new scientific ideas and discoveries. The emergence of the Internet has forced publishers to rethink their business model (Cope \&amp; Phillips, 2014), partly because scientists could, in principle, easily reach a broad audience and cut out the proverbial middleman. It is fair to say that commercial publishers adapted quite successfully as they arguably remain key players in the scientific publishing landscape (Cope \&amp; Kalantzis, 2014; Larivi\&\#232;re, Haustein, \&amp; Mongeon, 2015). However, academics have been criticizing publishers’ business practices for over a decade now (e.g., Dyer, 2004) and the call for reform has grown even louder in the past couple of years (Cope \&amp; Kalantzis, 2014; Corbyn, 2012 ; Flood, 2012 ). A prime example of such a reform initiative is the Cost of Knowledge campaign. Launched in response to a blog post by prominent mathematician Tim Gowers (2012 ), the campaign specifically targets the publishing house Elsevier, denouncing its attempts to restrict the free exchange of information, the exorbitantly high prices for subscriptions, and the practice of selling journals in large bundles featuring many unwanted titles . Signatories of the petition pledge to not referee for, publish in, or do editorial work for Elsevier journals. Roughly four years after the boycott started, it seems appropriate to evaluate its impact and contemplate its future.As a result of the boycott, several academics resigned from the editorial boards of numerous Elsevier journals. Moreover, the entire editorial board of the Elsevier journal Lingua resigned and started a new, open access journal called Glossa (Greenberg, 2015 ). The boycott thus changed the publishing landscape to a certain extent, but not as drastically as the organizers might have hoped.More importantly however, over 80\% of the nearly 16,000 signatories pledged to not publish in an Elsevier journal. This could gradually reduce the quality and thus the relevance of those journals. However, such a process takes time and its effects may not be readily discernible. One might, therefore, wonder whether it provides much leverage in persuading Elsevier, or any other publisher for that matter, to change its policies. Moreover, one could question the feasibility of such a (long-term) commitment, especially the “won’t publish” pledge. Given the seemingly ever-growing emphasis in academia on publishing papers in high impact journals, it might put a non-trivial burden on one’s career. From previous studies, and perhaps personal experience, we know that good resolutions sometimes run aground (Norcross, Mrykalo, \&amp; Blagys, 2002). But what about the “won’t publish” commitment? Do signatories stick to their guns and indeed refrain from publishing in Elsevier journals? This is an interesting question because the success of such an initiative largely depends on the persistence of its signatories. Put differently, a petition like the Cost of Knowledge can influence policy decisions to the extent that its signatories remain committed.To get an idea about the success rate of the “won’t publish” resolution, we checked signatories’ publication history after they signed the petition. Using ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Academia.edu, LinkedIn, ScienceDirect, and lab or personal websites, we were able to compile a bibliography for a large sample of “won’t publish” signatories. Due to the time consuming nature of this research, we limited ourselves to two subject areas, Chemistry and Psychology, each with approximately 500 signatories. It turns out that a substantial portion of the signatories was either unidentifiable (21\%) or hadn’t published in any outlet, to our knowledge, since signing (19\%). However, 23\% of the signatories did publish in an Elsevier outlet after signing the petition . This number is somewhat higher in Chemistry (29\%) compared to Psychology (17\%). The remaining 37\% indeed published exclusively in non-Elsevier outlets. In other words, 38\% of the publishing signatories abandoned their “won’t publish in an Elsevier outlet” commitment (i.e., 23\%/(23\%+37\%)). One needs to be cautious however, not to overinterpret this potentially devastating number. First, not every author may be consulted on where to submit a manuscript. Even though all authors should in principle approve the manuscript including the targeted outlet, some may not have been as integrally involved in the research and, consequently, have little say in these matters. Indeed, a small number of “won’t publish” signatories explicitly hedged their commitment, for instance, because they might not always choose the journal. Strictly speaking, one can refuse authorship in such cases, but various motivations may deter authors from taking this road (e.g., peer-pressure, the desire to be rewarded for the invested effort, etc…). To address this issue, signatories’ author positions were taken into account. In many fields, including Psychology and Chemistry, the first and last author positions are considered to be the most prestigious. These are typically reserved for the lead investigator and the supervisor or department head, respectively. Hence, it is often the case that the first and/or last author decides where to publish a manuscript. The data show that signatories are often “merely” co-authors (i.e., 46\% in Psychology, 65\% in Chemistry), yet they do occupy an influential position in many instances (i.e., only author: 2\% in Psychology, 1\% in Chemistry; first author: 26\% in Psychology, 12\% in Chemistry; last author: 26\% in Psychology, 22\% in Chemistry).Furthermore, there are a number of other reasons why signatories might have decided to publish in an Elsevier journal after all. Sometimes, there may be confusion about the publisher. For instance, Cell Press was originally an independent publisher with titles like Cell and Neuron, but it later became part of the Elsevier group. Consequently, these titles do not look like the typical Elsevier journal, which may have misled some signatories. In addition, most Elsevier journals now have a paid open access option and some are even completely open access (e.g., Sleep Science). It is fair to wonder whether such open access articles, especially the latter type, represent an abandonment of the “won’t publish in an Elsevier outlet” commitment.Taking these nuances into account, the earlier conclusion that 38\% of the publishing signatories broke their “won’t publish” promise, seems too pessimistic. However, it is also important to keep in mind that the present data concern a relatively short time span of maximally four years. One might thus wonder what the number would be in, say, ten years’ time. Furthermore, this search is limited to manuscripts that were eventually accepted for publication. The actual number of manuscripts submitted to an Elsevier journal, including those that were rejected or are currently under review, is arguably considerably higher. Finally, the publication history of some articles lacked the essential information to determine whether the author(s) signed the petition before or after submitting the manuscript. In such cases, we gave signatories the benefit of the doubt even though it was often fairly obvious that they abandoned their commitment. So, what is the take-home message? It is hard to live up to the “won’t publish” commitment, just like any other resolution. The entire situation actually resembles a social dilemma in which people might reason: “If I still publish in impactful Elsevier journals and most other researchers/signatories stop publishing in these journals, it will be good for my r\&\#233;sum\&\#233;/career, while Elsevier will have to change its ways.” From this point of view, the boycott’s moderate “success rate” is not surprising. That said, the Cost of Knowledge petition partly misses its goal if, after only four years, 38\% of the publishing signatories have in fact published in an Elsevier journal since signing. A petition can only influence policy making if its signatories are unified and remain committed to the cause in question. Furthermore, only 37\% of the “won’t publish” signatories are clearly boycotting Elsevier by publishing elsewhere. Extrapolating this figure to other domains would altogether amount to about 5,000 researchers – a drop in the ocean when we consider the total number of (publishing) scientists in the world . Barring a surge in (media) attention to the boycott, it seems unlikely that this number will grow substantially. Indeed, relatively few researchers have signed the petition in recent years, thus giving the impression that the boycott has run its course. That is to say, the negative publicity surrounding the boycott initially did elicit some (half-)measures from Elsevier (e.g., withdrawing support for the Research Work Act, a bill intended to restrict open access to research; Elsevier, 2012 ). However, any further changes resulting from the boycott as such seem utopian, unless other organizations join the cause. Put differently, efforts like these may require “high-level” support from universities and/or funding bodies to truly have an impact. For example, the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) launched a boycott against Elsevier last year, which involved asking journal editors to resign (Kinglsey, 2015 ). Soon after, they were able to reach an agreement with Elsevier about gradually granting open access to articles written by Dutch scientists (VSNU and Elsevier, 2015 ), though the agreement itself has already drawn criticism (Hartgerink, 2016 ). That doesn’t mean that individual researchers can only stand by and watch, though. Everyone can, for instance, help create a culture of transparency by uploading pre-and/or postprints to one’s personal website or repositories like arXiv. The effects may be modest (initially), but this “resolution” is easily attainable and ensures open access to (publicly-funded) research (see Bj\&\#246;rk, Laakso, Welling, \&amp; Paetau, 2014, for a review of this so-called green open access route). Taken together, the Cost of Knowledge petition is a noble initiative that fits into a broad movement to make research accessible and transparent. Yet, it might consider moving forward with only those who genuinely rally behind the call to boycott Elsevier, and even then, it remains highly questionable whether Elsevier will significantly change its ways.},

	abstract = {This study presents estimates of the global expenditure on article processing charges (APCs) paid to six publishers for open access between 2019 and 2023. APCs are fees charged for publishing in some fully open access journals (gold) and in subscription journals to make individual articles open access (hybrid). There is currently no way to systematically track institutional, national or global expenses for open access publishing due to a lack of transparency in APC prices, what articles they are paid for, or who pays them. We therefore curated and used an open dataset of annual APC list prices from Elsevier, Frontiers, MDPI, PLOS, Springer Nature, and Wiley in combination with the number of open access articles from these publishers indexed by OpenAlex to estimate that, globally, a total of {\textbackslash}\$8.349 billion ({\textbackslash}\$8.968 billion in 2023 US dollars) were spent on APCs between 2019 and 2023. We estimate that in 2023 MDPI ({\textbackslash}\$681.6 million), Elsevier ({\textbackslash}\$582.8 million) and Springer Nature ({\textbackslash}\$546.6) generated the most revenue with APCs. After adjusting for inflation, we also show that annual spending almost tripled from {\textbackslash}\$910.3 million in 2019 to {\textbackslash}\$2.538 billion in 2023, that hybrid exceed gold fees, and that the median APCs paid are higher than the median listed fees for both gold and hybrid. Our approach addresses major limitations in previous efforts to estimate APCs paid and offers much needed insight into an otherwise opaque aspect of the business of scholarly publishing. We call upon publishers to be more transparent about OA fees.},

	abstract = {As the open access movement has gained widespread popularity in the scientific community, academic publishers have gradually adapted to the new environment. The pioneer open access journals have turned themselves into megajournals, and the subscription-based publishers have established open access branches and have turned subscription-based journals into hybrid ones. Maybe the most dramatic outcome of the open access boom is the market entry of such fast-growing open access publishers as Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI). By 2021, in terms of the number of papers published, MDPI has become one of the largest academic publishers worldwide. However, the publisher’s market shares across countries and regions show an uneven pattern. Whereas in such scientific powers as the United States and China, MDPI has remained a relatively small-scale player, it has gained a high market share in Europe, particularly in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. In 2021, 28 percent of the SCI/SSCI papers authored/co-authored by researchers from CEE countries were published in MDPI journals, a share that was as high as the combined share of papers published by Elsevier and Springer Nature, the two largest academic publishers in the world. This paper seeks to find an explanation for the extensively growing share of MDPI in the publication outputs of CEE countries by choosing Hungary as a case study. To do this, by employing data analysis, some unique features of MDPI will be revealed. Then, we will present the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among Hungary-based researchers regarding MDPI and the factors that motivated them to publish in MDPI journals. Our results show that researchers generally consider MDPI journals’ sufficiently prestigious, emphasizing the importance of the inclusion of MDPI journals in Scopus and Web of Science databases and their high ranks and impacts. However, most researchers posit that the quick turnaround time that MDPI journals offer is the top driver of publishing in such journals.},

From June 2020 to February 2021, a consortium of 10 organisations undertook a large-scale study on open access journals across the world that are free for readers and authors, usually referred to as “OA diamond journals”. This study was commissioned by cOAlition S in order to gain a better understanding of the OA diamond landscape.


Presentation
The study undertook a statistical analysis of several bibliographic databases, surveyed 1,619 journals, collected 7,019 free text submissions and other data from 94 questions, and organised three focus groups with 11 journals and 10 interviews with hosting platforms. It collected 163 references in the academic literature, and inventoried 1048 journals not listed in DOAJ.


The results of the study are available in the following outputs:

Using publication data from WoS, OA status from Unpaywall, and annual APC prices from open data sets and historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, we estimate that globally authors paid \$1.06 billion in publication fees to these publishers from 2015–2018. Revenue from gold OA amounted to \$612.5 million, and \$448.3 million was obtained for publishing OA in hybrid journals. Among the five publishers, Springer Nature made the most revenue from OA (\$589.7 million), followed by Elsevier (\$221.4 million), Wiley (\$114.3 million), Taylor \&amp; Francis (\$76.8 million), and Sage (\$31.6 million). With Elsevier and Wiley making most of their APC revenue from hybrid fees and others focusing on gold, different OA strategies could be observed between publishers.},

	abstract = {The way in which we assess researchers has been under the radar in the past few years. Critics argue that current research assessments focus on productivity and that they increase unhealthy pressures on scientists. Yet, the precise ways in which assessments should change is still open for debate. We circulated a survey with Flemish researchers to understand how they work, and how they would rate the relevance of specific indicators used in research assessments. We found that most researchers worked far beyond their expected working schedule. We also found that, although they spent most of their time doing research, respondents wished they could dedicate more time to it and spend less time writing grants and performing other activities such as administrative duties and meetings. When looking at success indicators, we found that indicators related to openness, transparency, quality, and innovation were perceived as highly important in advancing science, but as relatively overlooked in career advancement. Conversely, indicators which denoted of prestige and competition were generally rated as important to career advancement, but irrelevant or even detrimental in advancing science. Open comments from respondents further revealed that, although indicators which indicate openness, transparency, and quality (e.g., publishing open access, publishing negative findings, sharing data, etc.) should ultimately be valued more in research assessments, the resources and support currently in place were insufficient to allow researchers to endorse such practices. In other words, current research assessments are inadequate and ignore practices which are essential in contributing to the advancement of science. Yet, before we change the way in which researchers are being assessed, supporting infrastructures must be put in place to ensure that researchers are able to commit to the activities that may benefit the advancement of science.},

	abstract = {Scientific publishing is rapidly shifting from a paper-based system to one of predominantly electronic distribution, in which universities purchase site licenses for online access to journal contents. Will these changes necessarily benefit the scientific community? By using basic microeconomics and elementary statistical theory, we address this question and find a surprising answer. If a journal is priced to maximize the publisher's profits, scholars on average are likely to be worse off when universities purchase site licenses than they would be if access were by individual subscriptions only. However, site licenses are not always disadvantageous. Journals issued by professional societies and university presses are often priced so as to maximize subscriptions while recovering average costs. When such journals are sustained by institutional site licenses, the net benefits to the scientific community are larger than if these journals are sold only by individual subscriptions.},

	abstract = {Scholarly communication in science, technology, and medicine has been organized around journal-based scientific publishing for the past 350 years. Scientific publishing has unique business models and includes stakeholders with conflicting interests—publishers, funders, libraries, and scholars who create, curate, and consume the literature. Massive growth and change in scholarly communication, coinciding with digitalization, have amplified stresses inherent in traditional scientific publishing, as evidenced by overwhelmed editors and reviewers, increased retraction rates, emergence of pseudo-journals, strained library budgets, and debates about the metrics of academic recognition for scholarly achievements. Simultaneously, several open access models are gaining traction and online technologies offer opportunities to augment traditional tasks of scientific publishing, develop integrated discovery services, and establish global and equitable scholarly communication through crowdsourcing, software development, big data management, and machine learning. These rapidly evolving developments raise financial, legal, and ethical dilemmas that require solutions, while successful strategies are difficult to predict. Key challenges and trends are reviewed from the authors’ perspective about how to engage the scholarly community in this multifaceted process.},
