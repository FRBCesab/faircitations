## Overview


Scientific journals operate over a broad spectrum of publishing strategies, from
strictly for-profit, to non-profit, and in-between business models (e.g. 
for-profit but academic friendly journals). Scientific publishing is 
increasingly dominated by for-profit journals, many of which attract prestige 
and submissions through high impact factors. In contrast, non-profit journals – 
those that reinvest revenue into the academic community – struggle to maintain 
visibility despite offering more equitable publishing models. 

To help rebalance this inequity, Beck _et al._ (in revision) propose a soft-power, 
low-risk strategy: strategic citation. By deliberately choosing to cite relevant
articles from non-profit journals when multiple references would be equally 
valid, researchers can contribute to increasing their visibility and future 
impact factor.

The aim of the R package `faircitations` is to provide a user-friendly way to 
compute the non-profit and academic friendly ratio of the bibliographic reference
list before submitting a manuscript for peer review.



## Features

`faircitations` reads a bibliographic file (e.g. BibTeX) to extract article DOI. 
Then it queries the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) bibliographic database to 
retrieve journal names. Finally it uses the 
[DAFNEE database](https://dafnee.isem-evolution.fr/) that provides the business 
model and the academic friendly status of several journals in the field of 
Ecology and Evolution to compute the non-profit and academic friendly ratio.

Currently two functions are implemented:

- the [`citation_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/faircitations/reference/citation_ratio.html) function helps user to compute citation ratios,
- the [`get_dafnee_journals()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/faircitations/reference/get_dafnee_journals.html) function lists the available DAFNEE journals.



## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install < remotes > package (if not already installed) ----
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install < faircitations > from GitHub ----
remotes::install_github("frbcesab/faircitations")
```

Then you can attach the package `faircitations`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("faircitations")
```



## Get started

The main function of `faircitations` is [`citation_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/faircitations/reference/citation_ratio.html). From a vector of article DOI, this  function will report the following metrics:

```{r eval=FALSE}
citation_ratio(doi = list_of_doi)
```

```
## $summary
##                                     metric value
##                           Total references    33
##                        References with DOI    33
##                    Deduplicated references    33
##               References found in OpenAlex    30
##                 References found in DAFNEE    10
##     Non-profit & acad. friendly references     9
##     For-profit & acad. friendly references     1
## For-profit & non-acad. friendly references     0
## 
## $ratios
## Non-profit & acad. friendly  For-profit & acad. friendly  For-profit & non-acad. friendly 
##                         0.9                          0.1                              0.0 
```
