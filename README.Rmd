## Overview


Scientific journals operate over a broad spectrum of publishing strategies, 
from strictly for-profit, to non-profit, and in-between business models 
(e.g. for-profit but academic friendly journals). Scientific publishing is 
increasingly dominated by for-profit journals, many of which attract prestige 
and submissions through high impact factors. In contrast, non-profit journals 
– those that reinvest revenue into the academic community – struggle to maintain
visibility despite offering more equitable publishing models.

The R package `fairpub` aims to provide a user-friendly toolbox to investigate 
the fairness of a research (article, bibliographic list, citation list, 
etc.). The fairness is measured according to two dimensions: 

- the **business model** of the journal: for-profit vs. non-profit
- the **academic friendly** status of the journal: yes or no

A journal with a non-profit business model is fairer than an academic friendly 
journal with a for-profit business model. But the later is still fairer than a
non-academic friendly journal with a for-profit business model.

This information comes from the 
[DAFNEE initiative](https://dafnee.isem-evolution.fr/), a Database of Academia 
Friendly jourNals in Ecology and Evolution.

The package `fairpub` also implements the method proposed by Beck _et al._ 
(in revision): the strategic citation. By deliberately choosing to cite relevant
articles from non-profit journals when multiple references would be equally 
valid, researchers can contribute to increasing their visibility and future 
impact factor. This method is implemented in the `fp_compute_ratio()` function 
and can answer the question **How fair am I when I cite previous works?** by 
computing the fairness ratio on the references cited in a manuscript.

The package can also answer the question **How fair is my publication list?**.
See the [Get started](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/articles/fairpub.html) 
vignette for more information.


## Features

The `fairpub` package can:

- retrieve the fairness status of a journal with the [`fp_journal_fairness()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_journal_fairness.html) function
- retrieve the fairness status of an article with the [`fp_article_fairness()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_article_fairness.html) function and by querying the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) bibliographic database
- compute the fairness ratio of a list references cited in a manuscript with the [`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html) function
- compute the fairness ratio of all publications of an author (or a team) with the [`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html) function

In addition, the [`fp_doi_from_bibtex()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_doi_from_bibtex.html) function helps user to easily extract DOI from a BibTeX file. The list of DOI can then be pass to the [`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html) function. 


## Limitation

The package `fairpub` provides a small subset of the journals indexed in the DAFNEE database.
We are currently working to increase this list of journals.


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install < remotes > package (if not already installed) ----
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install < fairpub > from GitHub ----
remotes::install_github("frbcesab/fairpub")
```

Then you can attach the package `fairpub`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("fairpub")
```



## Get started

The main function of `fairpub` is [`fp_compute_ratio()`](https://frbcesab.github.io/fairpub/reference/fp_compute_ratio.html). From a vector of article DOI, this function will report the following metrics:

```{r eval=FALSE}
fp_compute_ratio(doi = list_of_doi)
```

```
## $summary
##                                     metric value
##                           Total references    33
##                        References with DOI    33
##                    Deduplicated references    33
##               References found in OpenAlex    30
##                 References found in DAFNEE    10
##     Non-profit & acad. friendly references     9
##     For-profit & acad. friendly references     1
## For-profit & non-acad. friendly references     0
## 
## $ratios
## Non-profit & acad. friendly  For-profit & acad. friendly  For-profit & non-acad. friendly 
##                         0.9                          0.1                              0.0 
```

In this example, this list of references has a fairness ratio 
(`Non-profit and academic friendly`) of 90%. But this value must be interpreted 
with caution. Indeed this ratio has been computed on 26% (10 over 38) of the 
references, because the journal of 20 articles is not indexed in the DAFNEE 
database.
