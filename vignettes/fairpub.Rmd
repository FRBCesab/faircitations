## Introduction

Scientific journals operate over a broad spectrum of publishing strategies, 
from strictly for-profit, to non-profit, and in-between business models 
(e.g. for-profit but academic friendly journals). Scientific publishing is 
increasingly dominated by for-profit journals, many of which attract prestige 
and submissions through high impact factors. In contrast, non-profit journals 
– those that reinvest revenue into the academic community – struggle to maintain
visibility despite offering more equitable publishing models.

The R package `fairpub` aims to provide a user-friendly toolbox to investigate 
the fairness of a research (article, bibliographic list, citation list, 
etc.). The fairness is measured according to two dimensions: 

- the **business model** of the journal: for-profit vs. non-profit
- the **academic friendly** status of the journal: yes or no

A journal with a non-profit business model is fairer than an academic friendly 
journal with a for-profit business model. But the later is still fairer than a
non-academic friendly journal with a for-profit business model.

This information comes from the 
[DAFNEE initiative](https://dafnee.isem-evolution.fr/), a Database of Academia 
Friendly jourNals in Ecology and Evolution.

**Note:** The package `fairpub` provides a subset of the original DAFNEE database.
We are currently working to increase this list of journals.

The package `fairpub` also implements the method proposed by Beck _et al._ 
(in revision): the strategic citation. By deliberately choosing to cite relevant
articles from non-profit journals when multiple references would be equally 
valid, researchers can contribute to increasing their visibility and future 
impact factor. This method is implemented in the `fp_compute_ratio()` function 
and can answer the question **How fair am I when I cite previous works?** by 
computing the fairness ratio on the references cited in a manuscript.

The `fp_compute_ratio()` function can also be used to answer the question 
**How fair is my publication list?** by computing the fairness ratio on the 
bibliography of an author.


## Setup

Let's explore the features of `fairpub` but first let's load and attach the
`fairpub` package:

```{r setup}
library(fairpub)
```

Some functions of `fairpub` query the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) 
bibliographic database by using the 
[`openalexR`](https://docs.ropensci.org/openalexR/) package. As recommended by 
the OpenAlex API [documentation](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/rate-limits-and-authentication#the-polite-pool),
it's a good practice to send your email address to each query made by `openalexR`.

Use the function `options()` to store your email address as a global variable
available for the current session:


```{r 'setup_oa_api'}
options(openalexR.mailto = 'your_email@mail.com')
```

**Note:** No registration is required on the OpenAlex website.



## Journal fairness

The function `fp_journal_fairness()` of the package `fairpub` queries the DAFNEE
database to retrieve the fairness of a journal.

```{r 'fp_journal_fairness-1'}
fp_journal_fairness(journal = "Science")
```

This function returns a two-column `data.frame` with the name of the journal and
the fairness status of the journal. This fairness status can have the following
three values:

- Non-profit and academic friendly
- For-profit and academic friendly
- For-profit and non-academic friendly

This function searches for an exact match (case insensitive) but if the journal
is not found, a fuzzy search returns the three best candidates (low distance
between characters). For instance:

```{r 'fp_journal_fairness-2'}
fp_journal_fairness(journal = "Science of Nature")
```

Then, user can run this same function with the correct spelling:

```{r 'fp_journal_fairness-3'}
fp_journal_fairness(journal = "The Science of Nature")
```

As mentioned before, the list of DAFNEE journals included in `fairpub` is not 
exhaustive, and it's possible that many journals are missing.



## Article fairness

The function `fp_article_fairness()` of the package `fairpub` is dedicated to
retrieve the fairness of a scientific article. This function first queries the
[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) bibliographic database to find the journal
name from the DOI (digital object identifier) of the article. Then, the journal
name is used to query the DAFNEE database to get the fairness status.

**Note:** Even if this function works at the article level, this fairness status
is associated to the journal. In other words, all articles published in a journal
have the same fairness status.


```{r 'fp_article_fairness-1'}
fp_article_fairness(doi = "10.1126/science.162.3859.1243")
```

The output is identical to the output of `fp_journal_fairness()`, i.e. a 
two-column `data.frame`.

**Note:** if the DOI is not found in OpenAlex, the output will be:

```{r 'fp_article_fairness-2'}
fp_article_fairness(doi = "10.xxxx/xxxx")
```

**Note:** if the DOI is found in OpenAlex but the journal is absent from DAFNEE,
the output will be:

```{r 'fp_article_fairness-3'}
fp_article_fairness(doi = "10.21105/joss.05753")
```


## Citation ratio

One core function of `fairpub` is `fp_compute_ratio()`. It computes the fairness
ratio of a list of references cited in a manuscript. This ratio can be used by 
the author to replace some for-profit citations by fairer citations (e.g. 
citations of articles published in non-profit journals). Of course, if the findings
of two studies are similar.

This function uses one argument: a vector of DOI. The `fairpub` package provides
the `fp_doi_from_bibtex()` function that reads a BibTeX file and extracts all
available DOI.

Let's use the function `fp_doi_from_bibtex()` with the BibTeX file provided as 
an example in `fairpub`.


```{r 'fp_doi_from_bibtex-1'}
# Path to the BibTeX provided by 'fairpub' ----
filename <- system.file(
  file.path("extdata", "references.bib"),
  package = "fairpub"
)

# Extract DOI from this BibTeX file ----
doi_list <- fp_doi_from_bibtex(filename)
doi_list
```

**Note:** Make sure to check your references, especially the DOI field. In this
example, some references don't have a DOI (book, book chapter, etc.). The
`fp_doi_from_bibtex()` function don't remove these references to provide
a full report (see below the output of the `fp_compute_ratio()` function).

Now we have a vector of DOI, we can use the `fp_compute_ratio()` function to 
compute the fairness ratio of this list.

```{r 'fp_compute_ratio-1'}
fp_compute_ratio(doi = doi_list)
```

This function returns a two-element `list`:

- `summary`: a two-column `data.frame` with the number of references remaining
after each step of the workflow
- `ratio`: a three-element `vector` with value of the three fairness ratios

In this example, this list of references has a fairness ratio 
(`Non-profit and academic friendly`) of 90%. But this value must be interpreted 
with caution. Indeed this ratio has been computed on 26% (10 over 38) of the 
references, because the journal of 20 articles are not indexed in the DAFNEE 
database.


## Author ratio

It's possible to use the `fp_compute_ratio()` function to compute the fairness 
ratio of all publications of an author. In that case, the list of DOI should 
contain all articles published by this author.
